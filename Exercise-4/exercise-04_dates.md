This exercise contains two tasks:

1. Create a node program that tells you the current time and date. (whichDateAndTime)
2. Make a howMuchTimeUntilChristmas program that tells you how many seconds there are until Christmas.
 - Optionally (the script accepts one argument) make it tell you how many days there are.

Make for each task one file.

As always, put your code under git and publish your stuff on github, bitbucket or another plattform and send the link for the solutions to your trainer.

## HINTS

You can find the current time using:

```js
new Date();
```

You can get a date object for a specific date using:

```js
new Date(2022,11,25);
```

You can subtract one date object from another to get the number of milliseconds between them.

```js
dateOne - dateTwo;
```
